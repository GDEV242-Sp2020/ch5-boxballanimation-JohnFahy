/**
 * Class BouncingBall - a graphical ball that observes the effect of gravity. The ball
 * has the ability to move. Details of movement are determined by the ball itself. It
 * will fall downwards, accelerating with time due to the effect of gravity, and bounce
 * upward again when hitting the ground.
 *
 * This movement can be initiated by repeated calls to the "move" method.
